# 🚀 Multi-Modal Cross-Border Route Optimization  

## Tech Transit – LogiTHON 2024  

![Tech Transit](./Banner.png)  

## 📌 Problem Statement  
A small logistics provider needs a smart solution to determine the **best shipping route for cargo** traveling across borders using **multi-modal transportation** (land, air, and sea).  

Our solution: **Multi-Modal Cross-Border Route Selector** – an intelligent logistics system that provides optimized shipping routes based on factors like:  
✅ **Cost Efficiency**  
✅ **Transit Time Optimization**  
✅ **Cross-Border Feasibility**  
✅ **Capacity & Perishability Constraints**

## 🔍 How It Works  
1. **User Input:** Origin, destination, cargo details, and priority (cheapest vs. fastest).  
2. **Route Calculation:** Using **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**, we generate multi-modal routes with cost & time estimates.  
3. **Ranking & Optimization:** Routes are ranked based on efficiency, allowing users to choose the best option.  
4. **Output:** JSON response for easy front-end integration.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Frontend:** React, JavaScript  
- **Backend:** Python, Flask  
- **DataBase:** MySQL  
- **Algorithms:** Graph Theory, Dijkstra’s Algorithm  
- **Infrastructure:** Kubernetes  
- **Libraries:** NetworkX  

## 📊 Features  
- **Graph-Based Route Modeling** (Nodes = Cities, Ports, Airports | Edges = Transport Routes)  
- **Cost & Transit Time Estimation**  
- **Multi-Modal Optimization (Land, Air, Sea)**  
- **User-Friendly Interface**  
- **API for Integration**
